## NOTE: Purpose of this Fork

This is a fork of rtweet that fixes the search_fullarchive function. The current version of rtweet maxes tweets to 100 when using this function although the Twitter API allows up to 500. Because of this, rtweet will burn 2-5x the API requests that it needs to, which costs money.

Feel free to use this until the pull request that has been submitted to rtweet has been merged.

## RTweet
